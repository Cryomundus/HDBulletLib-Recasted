# Notes

This must be loaded after Hideous Destructor and before all addons.

## Contents

This library is limited only to the following:

- Bullets
- Loose Ammo (+ Boxes)

Magazines are out of this library's scope. On its own, the library only provides a framework. However, due to how HD generates items for ammo boxes and backpacks, options have been provided to remove those items. By default, no ammo from this mod will show up in backpacks and ammo boxes. It's better to opt-in than it is to opt-out in this case. Check out the menu.

Currently Includes:

- .50 AE by Accensus
- 12 Gauge Slugs, .500 S&W Lights and Heavies by Sledge
- .50 OMG by Bogus
- .45 ACP by Popguy
- 10mm Auto, .45 LC, Golden .45 LC, Less-Lethal Shells, Explosive Slugs and Flare Shells by Swampyrad
- .56 Caliber Musket Balls by Cozi and Ted
- 4-Gauge Saboted Slugs by Khan
- 5mm Bumblebee Rimfire, 6mm Flechettes and .50 Action-Mega by Potetobloke.
- 20mm Grenades, Thunder Rockets and Tortoise Rockets by Wanzer.

If you want to have your bullet added to the library or want to suggest any changes, feel free to fork the project and add it as a pull request for it to be added!
The only requirement for addition is that your round needs to fully function in-game and allow GZDoom to startup. There are no quality requirements at all, though it's preferable to have your round be fully created before getting pushed to the public.
